      | Use the arrow keys to move the cursor down to one of the below
      | items. Then type Ctrl+X to expand or collapse them, to have a
      | look around. The first one is recommended.
      |
      - Step 1) Explore these 3 options to find one that's right for you
      |
      + The 'xsh' command, and some shell key shortcut remappings/
        | This is the recommended, default xsh setup. It enables the
        | 'xsh' shell command. And it remaps the below key shortcuts
        | in your existing shell, to make them quickly switch to xsh.
        |
        |   Ctrl+X   Expand (meaning execute) a shell command in xsh
        |   Ctrl+T   Menu of all tasks for a command or dir
        |   Ctrl+G   Grab shell commands to and from xsh
        |   Ctrl+R   Recent commands (like existing Ctrl+R)
        |   Esc, then Tab   Xiki command menu
        |
        - Step 2) Enable this setup, or explore the other items
        |
        | To enable this setup, use the arrow keys to move down to this
        | item and type Ctrl+X to expand it:
        |
        + enable this configuration
          =replace/siblings/
            - Step 3) Confirm
            |
            | Move down to this item and type ^X (which means the same thing
            | as Ctrl+X) to confirm you want to save the following changes:
            |
            + save these changes
            |
#{files_to_update_preview}
            |
        |
        | Note: It's important that anyone who uses this account knows
        | that the behavior of Ctrl+R, Ctrl+X, Ctrl+T, and Ctrl+G has been
        | altered. If you're not confident about this, the next option is
        | recommended intead of this one.
        |
      - The 'xsh' command, and safer key shortcuts/
        | This is like the previous option, but creates key shortcuts
        | that don't conflict with your shells default shortcuts:
        |
        |   Esc, Ctrl+X   Expand a shell command in xsh
        |   Esc, Ctrl+T   Menu of possible tasks for a command or dir
        |   Esc, Ctrl+G   Grab shell commands to and from xsh
        |   Esc, Ctrl+R   Recent commands (like existing Ctrl+R)
        |   Esc, Tab      Xiki command menu
        |
        - Step 2) Enable this setup, or explore the other items
        |
        + enable this configuration
          =replace/siblings/
            - Step 3) Confirm
            |
            | Move down to this item and type ^X (which means the same thing
            | as Ctrl+X) to confirm you want to save the following changes:
            |
            + save these changes
            |
#{files_to_update_preview}
            |
        |
        | (You can use the arrow keys and Ctrl+X to select the above item.)
        |
      + Just the 'xsh' command/
        | Just install the 'xsh' command, and don't add any key
        | shortcuts in your existing shell.
        |
        - Step 2) Enable this setup, or explore the other items
        |
        + enable this configuration
          =replace/siblings/
            - Step 3) Confirm
            |
            | Move down to this item and type ^X (which means the same thing
            | as Ctrl+X) to confirm you want to save the following changes:
